- Missing SOLID principles no OPEN-CLOSE principle.
- Somes places are using hardcoded dependencies
- API responses are not following any standard pattern
- Error handling is not good
- Few things are not configurable and hardcoded in the code like the logger path
- Internationalizaing is not handled correctly
- The code is full of magic values
- Code breaks single responsibility pattern and weak separation of concerns
- Weak code documentation
- Few methods are too long and not broken down
